<h2>Tool #1: MIT App Inventor</h2> 
<h5>MIT App Inventor is a web application integrated development environment created by MIT in conjunction with Google, and now maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  It uses a block-based programming style which allows a user to build apps for mobile devices.  The layout is visual, and utilizes drag and drop which helps users understand the components needed for an app. MIT App Inventor combines a “Designer” screen to arrange the layout of your app and a “Code” screen to incorporate functionality.  Coding is like plugging puzzle pieces together.  MIT App Inventor is a free, open source web app that anyone can use. It was designed to be used by students ages 13 and up and is free to use. </h5>

<h5>I use App Inventor with my AP CSP class.  I like it because of the visual programming platform and gaming approach is applied without compromising on rigorous computer science concepts. The visual representation is appreciated by my students as they build apps for mobile devices and they can see the immediate results and actions on their personal phones. I have found that incorportaing mobile technology into my classroom has greatly captured my student's attention therefore better student engagement and improved student achievement. I definitely believe that the use of smart mobile devices in my classroom has contributed to retaining students' interest and attitudes in programming and thus significantly has improved their knowledge of basic programming concepts. </h5>



<h2>Tool #2: Nearpod</h2> 
<h5>Nearpod is an online student engagement platform that is a presentation resource that teachers can use in class to help students learn because it allows the teacher to give students questions like open-ended ones where they can type in their response, or the answers can be published in drawings where the students can actually draw on Nearpod to show their work in writing or drawings.  Nearpod also has fun games used as interactive learning activities like “Time to Climb” where the student chooses a character and answers questions created by the teacher. Each question that they get right will have the character climb a mountain higher and higher and accumulate points. All responses are automatically saved in a report that the teacher has access to and can download for later review. </h5>

<h3>I use Nearpod with all my classes.  Instead of a normal presentation platform like PowerPoint, I use Nearpod because it has many interactive features for students to learn. Besides the normal information slides, I can add activities such as multiple-choice questions, polls, videos with questions and much more. I have noticed that students are more engaged and answer questions without fear. I am able to hide the student names as we review the responses as a class. I am able to give feedback without having a student be embarrassed or feel as though they are put on the spot. I use it to give my Do Now as an interactive activity and set a timer that students can use to help manage their own time and keep them focused and on task. I also like that I can easily share my presentation with co-teachers and they can edit the lesson. I can also share the presentation with my students so that they can go back and review on their own time.</h3>
