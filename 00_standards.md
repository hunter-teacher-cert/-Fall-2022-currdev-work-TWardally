Assignment: 01 Compare 2 NYS CS Standards
Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards 

Standard #1: 9-12 CT.7-Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.
Course: Drone Programming
Programming Language: DroneBlocks

Students are to program the drone to complete a Box Mission. The drone must takeoff and fly in a square then land.They must use the fly forward and yaw right or left blocks. The Box Mission is a basic sequential computer programming structure.  The refactored Box Mission is to inclue the repeat block that now makes the program more abstract as it uses the repetition computer programming structure.   


Standard #2: 9-12 CT.10-Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
Course: AP CSP
Programming Language: App Inventor

Students are to create an app that illustrates a theme of the student's choice that must have at least 3 pictures and at least 3 sounds. The sounds must relate to the images select. The each image will be represented by a button component so that when an image is pressed a sound is played.  The sounds cannot be played at the same time. Therefore there must be code that includes the selection computer programming structure.
