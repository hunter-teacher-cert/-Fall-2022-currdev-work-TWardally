Name: Tanya Wardally

Assignment: 01 Compare and contrast local intro level class with a different APCSP curriculum

The 2 curriculums that I will compare is (1) Mobile CSP and (2) Microsoft TEALS Intro to Programming.

Curriculum Links
1. In 2021 Mobile CSP became part of Runestone Academy. Prior to Fall 2021 Mobile CSP had their own platform. The curriculum is the same however now your account is with Runestone and their are more features for the teachers on this platform. The link to the curriculum is https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/mobilecsp/index.html?mode=browsing
2.  The link to Microsoft TEALS Intro to Programming is https://tealsk12.github.io/introduction-to-computer-science/

SIMILARITIES:
The programming approach is through visual block-based programming languages. These curriculums have a hands on approach to learning in which students complete programming activities based on concepts in the lesson. Both run on computers with internet access and were designed to be full year long courses that meet daily for 45 minutes. Each curriculum has similar lesson structures that consist of a Launch, Instruction/Discussion, Activity, and Debrief/Reflection. CS videos are resources used by each curriculum.


DIFFERENCES:
Mobile CSP is an Advanced Placement level Computer Science course. The course is based on mobile computing and uses APP Inventor as the programming platform. Students build and design apps for tablets and smart phones. This curriculum does not only focus on coding but rather broad fundamentals of computer science. Aspects of the Internet and how encrytion is used to protect internet transactions is taught. As well as aspects of positive and negative computing in today's society. The core development is based on the five Big Ideas in the CSP framework and the six Computational Thinking Practices. Mobile CSP creates many of their own videos to explain concepts in the lesson. 

The Microsoft TEALS curriculum was adapted from another CS curriculum. The course uses SNAP as the programming platform. They use GitHub to manage versions and course updates. Teachers can submit a pull request in GitHub to recommend changes. There is also a GitHub Discussion board for general questions and a place to share lesson ideas and tips.   

It is my understanding that the MS TEALS Intro to CS curriculum used to be an approved AP CSP curriculum but 2 years ago was removed from College Board's list of approved curriculums. I don't think it has everything that is needed for the AP CSP exam and therefore I agree with College Board's decision. I do think that if more fundamental CS concepts were included then they could be a viable AP CSP curriculm in the future.
