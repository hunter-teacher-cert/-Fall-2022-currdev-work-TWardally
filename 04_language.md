<h1>Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)</h1>
<h2>Teacher: Tanya Wardally</h2>


<h3>What is the course?(grade level and student experience)</h3> 
<h5>The course I think would be a good fit for my IT Pathway would be AP CSA. This would be good for my seniors who have learned block coding in their introductory class as a freshmean as well as them taking APCSP also using block coding.</h5>
  
<h3>What is the language?</h3>
<h5>The language is Java.</h5>

<h3>How does one write & run code in this language?</h3>
<h5>Coding in Java requires the Java Development Kit and a text editor or IDE. Replit, IDE/Code Editor for Eclipse or VS Code could be used to run the code.</h5>

<h3>Rate the complexity of the syntax?</h3> 
<h5>Java is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, it is a great first line coding language for anyone brand new to coding. Even the most complex lines of Java code can be written one by one, in fragments. Its syntax is straightforward, making it easy to understand, write, and maintain.</h5> 

<h3>How would you utilize the strengths in the class?</h3> 
<h5>I would use the strengths of this program by having students be prepared to take the AP CSA exam. We would be able to run Java on any machine regardless of its operating system. </h5>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<h5>Java requires a lot of memory to function, making its computing speed slower than other languages. It lacks GUI.</h5>

<h3>How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?</h3>
<h5>I would mitigate the weaknesses by showing students other languages like Python, C++ and JavaScript that have similar syntax.</h5>
   
<h3>Why did you select this language for this class?</h3>
<h5>I selected this language because I like challenging myself since this language and course would be new for me. Eventually I want to teach AP CSA to my students.</h5>
